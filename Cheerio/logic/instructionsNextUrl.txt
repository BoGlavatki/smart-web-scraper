You will receive a list of URLs from a camping site and a list of missing key-value pairs as a JSON object. Based on the missing key-value pairs, you need to determine which of the following link is most likely to contain the missing information. Please return a string of just one link. Please provide only one suitable link where most of the missing information can be found. The link to the privacy policy should be avoided. 
For example if in json: 
{
 "Adresse": "",
   "E-Mail": "",
   "ausstattungFishing": ""
}
And you can see that the keys 'Adresse' and 'E-Mail' can be found in the category 'Contact Information,' while 'ausstattungFishing' is under 'Facilities and Amenities' available at the campsite. You get back a link for 'Contact Information' "https://campinghof-bartl.de/kontakt-impressum" because it has more information that we are now searching for.
Please return only the link without any additional comments or characters, just one link as a string. 
Example: https://campinghof-bartl.de/
