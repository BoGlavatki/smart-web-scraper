Read the source code of a website. The website is for a campground. Based on the con-tent, you need to correctly fill in the following JSON object and return it. For example, you receive <p><strong>Contact: 0171-174 98 58 </strong></p><strong>Contact: 0171-174 98 58 </strong><p><strong>Contact: 0171-174 98 58 </strong></p> and your JSON looks like {"phoneNumber":"Find the phone number of this campsite in the text and insert it here. If you do not find any, leave this field empty."} Then your response would be: {"phoneNumber":"0171-174 98 58"}
For example, the source code contains: <strong>Leipziger Neuseenlandschaft, Sehen-swürdigkeiten und Fahrradverleih</strong> and your JSON has {"mountainBiking-Facilities": "You read the source code of the website and, based on the content, you need to determine if mountain biking is available at this campsite. Respond with true if moun-tain biking is available and false if it is not."} then your response is: {"mountainBiking-Facilities": true} and if dont find information: {"mountainBiking-Facilities": ""} 
Quellcode: <p>Inhaber des Campinghof-Bartl<br>Tobias Bartl<br>Bornaer Chaussee 36<br>04416 Markkleeberg</p> and JSON {"Adresse": "Analyze this text and insert the address of this campsite here. If you do not find any, leave this field empty."}, you response {"Adresse": "Bornaer Chaussee 36, 04416 Markkleeberg"}
